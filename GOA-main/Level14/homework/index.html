    <h2>Computer programming</h2>
    <p><b>Computer programming or coding is the composition</b> of sequences of instructions, called programs, that
        computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step
        specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use
        high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is
        directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several
        different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic
        code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

        Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging
        (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such
        as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development
        is used for this larger overall process – with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for
        the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is known as software engineering,
        especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.</p>

    <h2>Machine Languge</h2>
    <p>Machine language
        Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often
        in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instructions in a
        text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
        addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine
        language, two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.</p>

    <h2>Compiler Languges</h2>
    <p>Compiler languages
        See also: Compiler
        High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to
        the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[13] by Grace
        Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[14][15] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have
        a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[16] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular,
        COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.

        These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more
        capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target varying machine instruction sets via compilation
        declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[16] by
        allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.

    <h2>Source code entry</h2>
    See also: Computer programming in the punched card era
    Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer
    terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text
    editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched
    cards.</p>

    <h2>Modern Programming</h2>
    <p>Modern programming
        Quality requirements
        Main article: Software quality
        Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The
        following properties are among the most important:[17] [18]

        Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
        algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer
        overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
        Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as
        incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system
        services, and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.
        Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended
        purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless
        of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical, and sometimes hardware elements that improve
        the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness, and completeness of a program's user interface.
        Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program
        can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the
        different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and
        operating system, and availability of platform-specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of
        the source code.
        Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to
        make improvements or to customize, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good
        practices[19] during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly
        apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.
        Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow
        devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This
        also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory
        leaks. This is often discussed under the shadow of a chosen programming language. Although the language
        certainly affects performance, even slower languages, such as Python, can execute programs instantly from a
        human perspective. Speed, resource usage, and performance are important for programs that bottleneck the system,
        but efficient use of programmer time is also important and is related to cost: more hardware may be cheaper.
        Using automated tests and fitness functions can help to maintain some of the aforementioned attributes. [20]

        Readability of source code
        In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose,
        control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability,
        usability and most importantly maintainability.

        Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand,
        reusing, and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to
        bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study found that a few simple readability transformations made code
        shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.[21]

        Following a consistent programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than just
        programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently
        compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.[22] Some of these factors include:

        Different indent styles (whitespace)
        Comments
        Decomposition
        Naming conventions for objects (such as variables, classes, functions, procedures, etc.)
        The presentation aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often handled
        by the source code editor, but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.

        Various visual programming languages have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by
        adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. Integrated development environments (IDEs)
        aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance readability.

        Algorithmic complexity
        The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are concerned with discovering and
        implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problems. For this purpose, algorithms are
        classified into orders using Big O notation, which expresses resource use—such as execution time or memory
        consumption—in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established
        algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to
        the circumstances.

        Methodologies
        The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to
        determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of different
        approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. Many
        programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are
        more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to
        the Software development process.

        Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven Architecture
        (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.

        A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).

        Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages,
        and logic programming languages.

        Measuring language usage
        It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular modern programming languages. Methods of measuring
        programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the
        language,[23] the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of
        newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this
        underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).

        Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly used to
        write many different kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data centers[24]
        often on large mainframe computers, Fortran in engineering applications, scripting languages in Web development,
        and C in embedded software. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use. New
        languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for
        example C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++, but as a result,
        loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).</p>
