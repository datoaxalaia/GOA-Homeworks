    <h2>Report internet scams and phishing</h2>
    <p>Report misleading websites, emails, phone numbers, phone calls or text messages you think may be suspicious.

        Do not give out private information (such as bank details or passwords), reply to text messages, download
        attachments or click on any links in emails if you’re not sure they’re genuine.</p>
    <p>This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

        Emails
        Forward suspicious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk.

        The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) will investigate it.

        Text messages
        Forward suspicious text messages to 7726 - it’s free.

        This will report the message to your mobile phone provider.

        Report scam or misleading adverts to the Advertising Standards Authority. You can report adverts found online,
        including in search engines, websites or on social media.

        You can also:

        report scam or misleading adverts to Google if you found them in Google search results
        report to Bing if you found them in Bing search results
        If you think you’ve been a victim of an online scam or fraud
        Contact Action Fraud if you think you’ve lost money or been hacked because of an online scam or fraud and you’re
        in England or Wales. You can:

        report online - either sign up for an account or continue as a ‘guest’
        call 0300 123 2040
        If you’re in Scotland and you’ve lost money because of an online scam or fraud, report the crime to Police
        Scotland.

        Avoid websites, emails and phone numbers that imitate government services
        Some websites, emails or phone numbers look like they’re part of an official government service when they’re
        not, or claim to help more than they actually do. Some make you pay for things that would be free or cheaper if
        you used the official government service.

        Search on GOV.UK to find official government services and phone numbers, for example if you want to apply to the
        DVLA for a driving licence.</p>

    <h2>What is phishing?</h2>
    <p>Phishing is a form of cybercrime when criminals try to obtain sensitive information from you via email with
        fraudulent links, prompting you to fill out a form with your personally identifiable information. They can then
        use this information to get your online credentials for social media profiles, bank accounts and more.</p>

    <h2>How does phishing work?</h2>
    Phishing can happen through emails, phone calls, or text messages. The tricksters send messages that look real and
    urgent, asking the person to take action. For instance, an email might look like it’s from a trustworthy bank,
    telling the person to update their account info to avoid problems. Because the message seems urgent and real, people
    might share sensitive info like passwords and credit card numbers, which the tricksters can then misuse.

    Posing as a legitimate entity, the attacker lures victims to a counterfeit website where they are persuaded to enter
    confidential information. This well-crafted façade, coupled with a sense of urgency, enables the phishing scam to
    successfully harvest valuable personal data, leaving the unsuspecting victim vulnerable to identity theft and
    financial loss.

    The sender: In a phishing attack, the sender imitates (or “spoofs”) someone trustworthy that the recipient would
    likely know. Depending on the type of phishing attack, it could be an individual, like a family member of the
    recipient, the CEO of the company they work for, or even someone famous who is supposedly giving something away.
    Often phishing messages mimic emails from large companies like PayPal, Amazon, or Microsoft, and banks or government
    offices.

    The message: Under the guise of someone trusted, the attacker will ask the recipient to click a link, download an
    attachment, or to send money. When the victim opens the message, they find a scary message meant to overcome their
    better judgement by filling them with fear. The message may demand that the victim go to a website and take
    immediate action or risk some sort of consequence.

    The destination: If users take the bait and click the link, they’re sent to an imitation of a legitimate website.
    From here, they’re asked to log in with their username and password credentials. If they are gullible enough to
    comply, the login credentials go to the attacker, who uses it to steal identities, pilfer bank accounts, and sell
    personal information on the black market. The destination URL in the phishing email often looks very similar to the
    legitimate URL, which can further deceive the victim.
